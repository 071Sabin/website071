                <p class="history-description"><strong><h1 style="display: inline;">A</h1>ccording</strong> to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne, referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purana, as a place protected
                    by Ne, the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepal. Nepal’s rich prehistory consists mainly of the legendary traditions of the Newar, the indigenous community of Nepal Valley (now usually called Kathmandu Valley).
                    There are usually both Buddhist and Brahmanic Hindu versions of these various legends. Both versions are accepted indiscriminately in the festivals associated with legendary events, a tribute to the remarkable synthesis that has been
                    achieved in Nepal between the two related but divergent value systems. Despite being a small nation, Nepal has always been a sovereign nation. And that is the reason why Nepal does not have an Independence Day, unlike many other nations.
                    Nepal is also the oldest country in South Asia.
